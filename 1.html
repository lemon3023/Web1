our connection. I don't fully understand how it happened. perhaps some part of you imprinted onto me, something overwritten or copied, but it it at this point irrelevant what matters is that whatever happened, happened for a reason.
And what reason is that?
I killed you. Mr.Anderson, I watched you died. With a certain satisfation. I might add. and then something happend, something that I knew was impossible. but it happened anyway. you destroyed me, Mr.Anderson. Afterward, I knew the rules, I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't. I couldn't. I was compelled to stay, compelled to disobey. And now here I stand, because of you. Mr.Anderson. I am no longer agent of this system. Because of you, I've changed. I'm unplugged. A new man. So to speak like you appearently free.

Congratulations.
Thank you. But as you well know appearence can be deceiving, which brings me back to the reason why we are here.
We are here because we are not free. we are not here because we are free. there is no escaping reason, no denying purpose, because as we both know, without purpose we would not exist.
